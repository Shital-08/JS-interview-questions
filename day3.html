    <h1>DAY 3</h1>

    <h3>1. What is the use of setTimeout.</h3>
    <pre>The setTimeout() method executes a block of code after the specified time. The method executes the code only once.</pre>
    <script>
        setTimeout(function () {
            console.log("Good morning");
          }, 2000);
    </script>

    <h3>2. What is an event loop and call stack.</h3>
    <pre>
    <b>Event Loop :</b>The event loop is a constantly running process that monitors both the callback queue and the call stack.
    <b>Callstack :</b>A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions.
    </pre>

    <h3>3. What are arrow functions?</h3>
    <pre>
    Arrow function is one of the features introduced in the ES6 version of JavaScript. 
    It allows you to create functions in a cleaner way compared to regular functions. 
    </pre>
    <script>
        let greet = () => console.log('Hello');
        greet(); 
    </script>
    
    <h3>4. What is a Temporal Dead Zone?</h3>
    <pre>
    A temporal dead zone (TDZ) is the area of a block where a variable is inaccessible until the moment the computer completely initializes it with a value.
    </pre>

    <h3>5. what is hoisting?</h3>
    <pre>
         Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.
         Hoisting allows functions to be safely used in code before they are declared.
    </pre>

    <h3>6. What is the DOM?</h3>
    <pre>
         The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. 
         It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. 
         The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.
    </pre>
 
    <h3>7. Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN</h3>
    <pre>
    Undefined: Undefined is a datatype in JS which means a variable is declared but its value is not specified. It is also the default value of a variable declared using 'var' upon hoisting.</p>
    Not defined: Not defined is shown on the console when a variable is used for something but it was never declared.</p>
    NAn: NAN stands for 'not a number' which is the value given to a number if it contains alphabets or any special character.
