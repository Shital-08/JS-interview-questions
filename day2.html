    <h1>DAY 2</h1>
    <h3>1. What is creation phase and execution phase?</h3>
    <pre>
     <b>Creation Phase</b> : The JS engine invokes a function but does not start its execution during the creation phase. 
     The JS engine starts the compilation step in this phase and examines the function code for compiling but does not run it.
     During the creation phase, two-state components are created:
     1. Lexical Environment
     2. Variable Environment

     <b>Execution</b> : The JS engines scan over the function in the code one more time, updating the variable object with the values of the variables and then running the code, which is known as an execution phase.
     Variable binding initializations, variable assignments, mutability and immutability checking, variable binding deletions, function call execution, and so on are all occurring during this phase.
    </pre>

    <h3>2. What are objects in javascript?</h3>
    <pre>JavaScript object is a non-primitive data-type that allows you to store multiple collections of data in the form of key-value pairs.
        <script>
            // object creation
            const person = { 
            name: 'John',
            age: 20
            };
            console.log(typeof person); // object
    </script>
    </pre>

    <h3>3. What are function constructors?</h3>
    <pre>The Function() constructor creates a new Function object. Calling the constructor directly can create functions dynamically.
    </pre>
    <script>
        const sum = new Function('a', 'b', 'return a + b');
        console.log(sum(4, 6));
    </script>

    <h3>4. Explain prototypes.</h3>
    <pre>A prototype is an existing inbuilt functionality in JavaScript. Whenever we create a JavaScript function, JavaScript adds a prototype property to that function. 
         A prototype is an object, where it can add new variables and methods to the existing object.
    </pre>
    <script>
      function Person1(name, yearOfBirth){   
    this.name= name;
    this.yearOfBirth= yearOfBirth;
    }
    console.log(Person1.prototype); 
    </script>

    <h3>5. What is prototype chain.</h3>
    <pre>The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's called a prototype chain. 
         The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype.
    </pre>
    <script>
        function student() {
        this.name = 'John'
    }
    student.prototype.name = 'Peter';
    student.prototype.age = 23

    const student1 = new student();
    console.log(student1.name); // John
    console.log(student1.age);
    </script>
 
    <h3>6. Give an example of inheritance using function constructor.</h3>
    <pre>Inheritance is something when child is inheriting the properties of parent.</pre>
    <script>
        function Employee(name, age, gender, id) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
            this.gender = gender;
            this.id = id;
        };
        function Developer(name, age, gender, id, 
        specialization) {
            Employee.call(this, name, age, gender, id);
            this.specialization = specialization;
        }
        console.log(Employee.prototype);
        console.log(Developer.prototype);
    </script>

    <h3>7. What are callbacks?</h3>
    <pre>A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function.</pre>
     <script>
        function greet(name, callback) {
        console.log('Hi' + ' ' + name);
        callback();
        }
        function callMe() {
        console.log('I am callback function');
        }
        greet('Roohi', callMe);
     </script>
