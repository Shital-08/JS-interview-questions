<h1>DAY 5</h1>

<h3>1. What is the for-in loop in JavaScript? Give its syntax.</h3>
<pre>
The for..in loop in JavaScript allows you to iterate over all property keys of an object.
In each iteration of the loop, a key is assigned to the key variable. The loop continues for all object properties.
The syntax of the for...in loop is:

for (key in object) {
    // body of for...in
}
</pre>
<script>
let string = 'code';
for (let i in string) {
    console.log(string[i]);
}
</script>

<h3>2. Explain Local Scope, Block Scope, Functional Scope and Scope Chain in javascript.</h3>
<pre>
Local scope: Variables declared inside a function become local to the function. 
Local variables are created when a function starts and deleted when the function is executed. 
Local variables have Function Scope which means that they can only be accessed from within the function.

Block Scope: let and const are the two new important keywords that were introduced by the ES6 and these two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.
Variables that are declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block.

Functional Scope: JavaScript has function scope and each function creates a new scope. 
Variables defined inside a function are not accessible from outside the function and variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared inside a function.

Scope Chain: JavaScript engine uses scopes to find out the exact location or accessibility of variables and that particular process is known as Scope Chain.
Scope Chain means that one variable has a scope (it may be global or local/function or block scope) is used by another variable or function having another scope (may be global or local/function or block scope).

<h3>3. What is difference between null and undefined and where to use what?</h3>
<pre>
                Undefined	                                             NULL
    1.The undefined property indicates that               1. The value null represents the
     a variable has not been declared at all.             absence of any object value

    2.Its supported browsers are -:                       2. Its supported browsers are -:
      Chrome, Microsoft Edge ,                            Chrome, Microsoft Edge ,  
      Internet Explorer , Firefox ,                       Internet Explorer , Firefox ,
      Safari , Opera Mini.                                Safari , Opera Mini.                      
    
    3.Null is converted to zero (0) while                3. Undefined is converted to NaN while 
     performing primitive operations.                       performing primitive operations.
                                       
    4.The null value is a primitive value                4. The undefined value is a primitive value, 
      which represents the null, empty,                     which is used when a variable has 
      or non-existent reference.                            not been assigned a value.  
</pre>  

 <h3>4. what is Symbol?</h3>
 <pre>
The JavaScript ES6 introduced a new primitive data type called Symbol. 
Symbols are immutable (cannot be changed) and are unique. 
 </pre>
 <script>
let x = Symbol('hey');
console.log(x);
 </script>

 <h3>5. Write code to explain map and filter in arrays.</h3>
 <pre>
 map() :The map() method is used for creating a new array from an existing one, applying a function to each one of the elements of the first array.
 </pre>
 <script>
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
var doubled = numbers.map(item => item * 2);
console.log(doubled);
</script>

<pre>
filter():The filter() method takes each element in an array and it applies a conditional statement against it. If this conditional returns true, the element gets pushed to the output array. 
If the condition returns false, the element does not get pushed to the output array.
</pre>
<script>
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
var evens = numbers.filter(item => item % 2 === 0);
console.log(evens);
</script>

<h3>6. Explain passed by value and passed by reference.</h3>
<pre>
Pass by Value: The method parameter values are copied to another variable and then the copied object is passed, 
that’s why it’s called pass by value.
</pre>
<script>
let a = 30;
let b = a ;
b = a + 20;
console.log(a);
console.log(b);
</script>

<pre>
Pass by Reference: An alias or reference to the actual parameter is passed to the method, 
that’s why it’s called pass by reference.
</pre>
<script>
 let obj1 ={
 name :"Anvi",
 age : 20,
 }
 let obj2 = obj1;
 obj2.age = 24;
 console.log(obj1);
 console.log(obj2);
</script>

<h3>7. explain Self Invoking Function and its code.</h3>
<pre>
 A self-invoking (also called self-executing) function is a nameless (anonymous) function that is invoked immediately after its definition.
 Self-invoking functions are useful for initialization tasks and for one-time code executions, without the need of creating global variables.
 </pre>
 <script>
(function(x){
console.log(x);
})("Hello, World!");
 </script>
